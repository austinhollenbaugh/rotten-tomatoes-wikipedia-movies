Combining Rotten Tomatoes movie scores with Wikipedia movie subject categories.

E.g., a film set in the 1930s with an 80%+ RT rating.

maybe I want to watch a movie set in the 1930s, but I want it to be a *good* movie.

Wikipedia has really good categories for year of setting, but they put everything into the same category, good or bad.

Rotten Tomatoes has good ratings, but very little categorization (besides year and cast/crew, maybe).

Basically, I find myself navigating Wikipedia a lot and thinking "OK, but which of these movies are *good.* "

(I could click on each Wikipedia article to look at individual ratings/awards, but that's kind of a pain.)

But this might be kind of a niche problem. I do think that combining metadata from different sites is interesting, though.

Okay, so the data from Rotten Tomatoes and Wikipedia would be combined into a sort of comprehensive movie encyclopedia?

Or maybe it would be a way to navigate RT using subject categories?
